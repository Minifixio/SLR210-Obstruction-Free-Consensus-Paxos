A skeleton code base to implement Synod (Paxos) in Akka.


Todo:
Do 5 times and take the average
	Get the mesures to a file for all values of tle, N and alpha
After initialising  all instances, wait for the return message containing the time of execution. Then start the next one.
Add a for loop to do this experiment 5 times and compute the average time.
Print the data to a file


Make the graphs python ? (see graphPlots.ipynb)
Make a graph for fixed N and different tle 
Make a graph for fixed Tle and different N
Make a graph for fixed N and TLE with fixed alpha

Do the data gathering on the same computer!!!!
